# Alert-O-Monitor
# Data Engineering
1. Create Microsoft Lakehouse.
2. Under the Data Engineering folder, we have Raw Files sub-folder which has all the raw-data files and these files can be uploaded into the lakehouse files and create tables on top of it.
3.  Under the Data Engineering folder, we have Lookup Files sub-folder which has all the loop-up files and these files can be uploaded into the lakehouse files and create tables on top of it.
4.  Once the Tables are created, Pick up all the notebooks from the Data Engineering folder.
5.  Run all the notebooks(note: main notebook needs to be run at the end).

# Data Modeling
1. Create a new semantic model on top of the lakehouse.
2. Create the relationships as shown in below.
